## Our Mission 🚀

At Servii, we believe in creating a better world through technology. We strive to develop projects that not only solve problems but also inspire and empower our community. Our mission is to foster innovation, collaboration, and excellence in everything we do.

## Rules & Guidelines 🛠️

### 1. **Code Quality 🖥️**

- All code must adhere to the highest standards of quality and readability. This ensures that our projects are maintainable and scalable.
- We encourage the use of linting tools and static analysis to catch potential issues early.

### 2. **Review Process 🔍**

- Every contribution, whether it's a new feature or a bug fix, must undergo a thorough review process. This helps us ensure that our codebase remains consistent and high-quality.
- Pull requests should be well-documented, explaining the changes made and why they were necessary. 

### 3. **Documentation 📝**

- Documentation is crucial for the success of our projects. Each project must have clear, comprehensive documentation that explains how it works, how to contribute, and how to deploy it.
- We recommend using tools like Readme.io or MkDocs to create and manage your documentation.

### 4. **Licensing 📜**

- All projects under Servii must be properly licensed. Open-source licenses such as MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL v3 are recommended, depending on the nature of the project.
- Ensure that the license is clearly stated in the repository's README and in the source code itself.
